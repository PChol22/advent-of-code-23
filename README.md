# Advent of Code 2023 - JavaScript and C++ - By Pchol22

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges.

- 🏆 I am competing using **JavaScript**.
- 🐣 I also try to solve the challenges using **C++**, to get better at it.

Each folder contains the JS and C++ solution to the corresponding day, plus a input.txt file containing **MY** input data for that day. Replace the input data with your own if you need to!

## How to run JavaScript solutions?

Example for day 1:

```bash
node ./day1/solution.js
```

## How to run C++ solutions?

Example for day 1:

```bash
cd ./day1
g++ solution.cpp -o output && ./output && rm output
```
